Overview
The Advanced Password Strength Checker Tool is a sophisticated application developed using Python and Tkinter, designed to analyze and enhance the strength of passwords. The tool provides a robust mechanism for evaluating password security by considering various factors such as length, complexity, uniqueness, and resistance to common attacks. Additionally, it offers features for password generation and immediate feedback on password strength, making it a valuable asset for users concerned with maintaining strong, secure passwords.

Key Features
Comprehensive Password Analysis:

Evaluates passwords based on length, complexity, and character diversity.
Checks against common weak passwords and dictionary words.
Detects repeated patterns and sequences.
Calculates entropy to assess password randomness.
Visual Feedback:

Displays password strength through an intuitive pie chart.
Provides detailed textual feedback, guiding users on improving their password security.
Password Generation:

Generates strong, random passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
Option to copy the generated password directly to the clipboard for convenience.
User-Friendly Interface:

Toggle to show or hide passwords while typing for both input and generated passwords.
Clear instructions and feedback to assist users in creating robust passwords.
Installation
To install and run the Advanced Password Strength Checker Tool on your system, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-password-checker.git
cd advanced-password-checker
Install Required Dependencies:
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the necessary libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: The required Python libraries include pyperclip and matplotlib.

Run the Application:
Execute the Python script using the terminal:

bash
Copy code
python3 advanced_password_checker.py
Usage
The application is straightforward to use, with a simple graphical user interface (GUI) guiding users through the password evaluation process.

Enter Your Password:

Type your password in the input field.
Check the "Show Password" option to view the password in plain text if needed.
Check Password Strength:

Click the "Check Strength" button to analyze your password.
View the score and feedback provided, along with a visual pie chart depicting the password strength.
Generate a Strong Password:

Click the "Generate Strong Password" button to create a new secure password.
Use the "Show Generated Password" option to display it in plain text.
Click "Copy" to transfer the generated password to the clipboard for easy access.
Detailed Features
Password Complexity Evaluation:

The tool assesses lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and symbolic content to provide a comprehensive complexity score.
Rewards are given for passwords that utilize a wide range of characters.
Dictionary and Common Password Checks:

Identifies passwords that contain dictionary words or match commonly used weak passwords.
Applies penalties for passwords that are too similar to weak or common passwords using Levenshtein distance.
Entropy Calculation:

Measures the unpredictability of the password using entropy metrics.
Encourages passwords with higher entropy scores for enhanced security.
Pattern Recognition:

Detects repeating sequences or patterns, which are often signs of weak passwords, and adjusts the score accordingly.
Graphical Representation:

The pie chart provides a clear visual representation of password strength, making it easier to understand areas of improvement.
Feedback System:

Offers specific advice on how to enhance password strength based on identified weaknesses, encouraging users to create more secure passwords.
Example
Hereâ€™s an example of how the tool provides feedback and visual representation:


plaintext
Copy code
Score: 75
Feedback: Moderate password. Add special characters. Increase password length or complexity. Avoid common passwords.
Potential Enhancements
This project can be extended with additional features, including:

Customizable Password Policies:

Allow users to set specific password requirements based on organizational or personal security standards.
Advanced Pattern Recognition:

Implement AI-based detection for sophisticated pattern identification.
Language Support:

Add multi-language support to cater to a global audience.
Integration with Password Managers:

Provide export options or direct integration with popular password managers for seamless password storage and retrieval.
